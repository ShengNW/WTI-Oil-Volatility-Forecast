# WTI-Oil-Volatility-Forecast
This repository replicates the core framework from Baruník, J., &amp; Krehlík, T. (2016), which combines high-frequency data with non-linear models to forecast energy market volatility. We extend the analysis to a newer dataset: 1-minute, 5-minute, and daily prices of CL (WTI crude oil) futures traded on the NYMEX from 2015 to 2024.
